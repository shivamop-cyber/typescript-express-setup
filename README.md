## A project structure to create express/node server using typescript

This project takes the knowledge of how to create a express server with typescript
and compiles them at one place.

I used multiple sources to create this project but [this](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-set-up-node-typescript-express/) article was the main source I followed.

To run this project, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) should be preinstalled on your system.

To install the project dependencies run the following command

    npm install

After that to run the project locally in development mode run:

    npm run dev
